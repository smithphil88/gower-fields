# Introduction

This is a fictional website to give potential customers an idea of what Gower Fields provides. Gower Fields provides the users somewhere where they can let their dogs off the lead in a safe environment. Owners are able to relax while their pets run or walk in the secure fields provided. Gower Fields allows owners a chance to interact with other dog owners and they can socialise their pets if so desired.

## Design

### Fonts & Colours

Google fonts was used in order to import Poppins and as a back-up font Sans Serif. Poppins was chosen to convey a modern and simple style while being easy to read. A colour scheme was chosen from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). This colour scheme was chosen to convey the mood of the website. The earth coloured tones set the atmosphere of the site as it evokes feelings of being outside in nature. The colours were slightly altered from the original palette due to contrast issues.

### Images 

All images have been taken from websites that will be attributed in the credits section. These images have been re-sized to make them more appealing and consistent using a re-sizing tool. The images used are included to add to the visual appeal of the site. The colours in the images are ones with neutral and natural tones to keep inline with the colour scheme that was chosen.

## Deployment

## Bugs 

This list compromises of the bugs that I had significant struggles with;

![images not loading when deployed](documentation/bug-1.png)

- The width of the background was shorter than the footer - fixed by hiding the overflow of the footer.

![screen width not loading the full width](documentation/bug-2.png)

- Error code 404 shown when previewing site. Favicon on tab was not loading correctly - fixed by adding in code for favicon to load.
