# Testing

In this section, I will demonstrate a variety of tests that my site went through to ensure that it hit the criteria of the assessment.

## Code Validation

#### HTML validation

I have put all html pages through the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) in order to validate my site.

Home page - passed with no errors

Gallery page - passed with no errors but with warnings.

Contact page - passed with no errors but with warnings.

Response page - passed with no errors but with warnings.

![Response page](documentation/html-validation-5.png)

All warnings suggested that I use h2-h6 values to organise the page. Or to use a div to organise them. I have used a div but the warnings still appeared.

#### CSS validation

I used the suggested [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS.
